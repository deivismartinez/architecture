## Evolution of Software Architecture

The article highlights how software architecture has evolved over time, moving from fixed architectural blueprints to adapting to changing customer demands and the availability of new tools.

## Change in Architect Responsibilities

Previously, architects used to make critical decisions regarding scalability, technology, and application architecture. However, the availability of auto-scaling, orchestration, and analysis tools has reduced the need for architects to make all these decisions. Now, responsibility has been more widely shared within teams.

## Changes in Consumption Patterns

The article points out how the evolution of cloud computing and consumption patterns has led to a greater focus on rapid delivery and flexibility. Customers have more active demands, and teams must adapt quickly to these demands.

## Shared and Collaborative Architecture

The importance of shifting from an individually led architecture to a shared and collaborative architecture is emphasized. The challenges of this shift in ownership and collaboration are described.

## Continuous Evolution of Architecture

It is underscored that software architecture is an ever-changing, evolutionary process, and architects must constantly adapt to address changing customer needs and technological opportunities.

## The Role of the Architect as a Facilitator and Communicator

The article highlights that modern architects must play a role as facilitators and communicators, helping teams understand and address technical and design challenges. They must also be capable of teamwork and building effective relationships.

## Shift Towards Team Play

It is mentioned that software architecture is no longer an individual activity but a "team play." Architects must learn to trust other team members and share responsibility.

## Coaching Skills

In addition to technical competence, the importance of coaching skills for architects is emphasized. They should be able to provoke deep thoughts and gain diverse perspectives from team members.

## Evolution of Skills

Architects must be willing to evolve and learn new skills, including business and effective communication skills.

## The Importance of Inclusivity and Psychological Safety

It is emphasized that teams must be inclusive and create an environment of psychological safety where ideas and opinions can be expressed without fear of retaliation.
