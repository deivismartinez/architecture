## Software Development Cycle

1. It starts with gathering customer requirements.
2. Then, software architecture is designed.
3. The first version (version one) is developed based on this design.
4. The version is delivered to the customer, and their feedback is collected.
5. Customer feedback is incorporated into future versions, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

## Speed in Software Delivery

- Advanced technologies have accelerated software delivery.
- High speed is crucial but must maintain existing software functionality.
- The delivery process has stages of experimentation, stories, and tasks.

## Tools for Accelerating Delivery

- Use of tools like SonarQube for code analysis.
- Unit testing to ensure existing functionality.
- Automated build and deployment with CI/CD and containers like Docker.

## Microservices

- Microservices are independent and scalable units.
- They are beneficial for geographically separated teams and improve fault isolation.
- However, they have challenges like complexity and management in small organizations.

## Approaches to Overcome Microservices Challenges

- Domain Oriented Microservices (DOMA) divides microservices into domains managed by teams.
- Event Driven Architecture (EDA) reduces coupling and enables scalability.
- Choreography and orchestration are used to manage microservices.

## Serverless Architecture

- Ideal for applications with heavy data loads and horizontal scalability.
- Pay-as-you-go, making it cost-effective.

## Command Publish Consume Query (CPC)

- Different from Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
- Publishes commands that are received in a database or messaging system.

## Micro Front End

- Segregation of user interfaces based on domains.
- Uses frameworks like Single SPA to build micro frontends.

## Evolutionary Architecture

- Utilizes an architectural fitness function to ensure architecture evolves correctly.
- Fitness functions are integrated into automated development pipelines.

## Other Important Trends

- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML).
- Edge Computing.
- Blockchain.
- Data-intensive computing.
- Low-code/no-code application development (LCNC).
- Hybrid cloud.
- Multiple data sources.
- Real-time streaming.

## The Future of Quantum Computing

- Quantum computing is forecasted to change many aspects of technology, from security to other fields.
- Expected to play a significant role in our daily lives in the next 6-7 years.
